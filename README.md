# SimpleSMPS
A simple SMPS player running off of official source code.

Example files are taken from the [official source code](https://hiddenpalace.org/News/Sega_of_Japan_Sound_Documents_and_Source_Code).

Go to [the wiki page](https://github.com/MDTravisYT/SimpleSMPS/wiki) to learn how to use SMPS and this player.

This repository currently only supports the 68000+Z80 version of the driver, but standalone Z80 is planned.
