# SimpleSMPS
A simple SMPS player running off of [official source code](https://hiddenpalace.org/News/Sega_of_Japan_Sound_Documents_and_Source_Code).

The 68000 program conversions are borrowed from [superctr's fork of the source](https://github.com/superctr/SMPS/tree/master).

Go to [the wiki page](https://github.com/MDTravisYT/SimpleSMPS/wiki) to learn how to use SMPS and this player.

This repository currently only supports the 68000+Z80 version of the driver, but standalone Z80 is planned.
